#### A SAR Kelvin Wake Full-Link Simulator

KWFull-Link_SARSim is a simulator for Kelvin wakes in SAR images. Unlike the previous approximation model, we adopt the full-link simulation to realize the simulation of sea surface SAR imaging, and the simulation process includes the process of electromagnetic scattering, sea surface motion, platform motion, pulse-echo generation, radar signal acquisition, image processing, etc.

Since our paper is currently undergoing review, we are only able to provide the lite version of the executable program.

Note:  Before running SAR_Simulator_ShareVersion.exe, you must download the necessary .dll files from [Baiduyun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17GhClkoXFURNO6Dchb7KGA?pwd=9mjr ) or [Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqTp7jo0qiKFkTIpZbI8QRAh2Whr?e=eZDKGh) and put them under the same directory!
